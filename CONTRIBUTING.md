Hundreds and hundreds amount of developers across the world united build the contributor world we know today: and we fortunate to be in such a beatiful world, so, for any foreign developer, which wants to make a contribution to this project - there are some conventions and guidelines he must met before making any changes to not make things diffucult for anyone.

Guidelines for contributions
----------------------------

We appreciate community contributions to project or documentation, the following list shows some guiding rules to keep in mind when you're contributing to the software (definition from MIT license):

- **DON'T** surprise us with large pull requests, instead, file an issue and start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time;
- **DON'T** include sample code inline in an push;
- **DO** use a snippet project with code to be embedded in the article;
- **DO** follow these instructions and code of conduct;
- **DO** use the forked repository as the starting point of your work;
- **DO** create a separate branch on your fork before working on the project;
- **DO** follow the [GITHUB flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/);
- **DO** blog and tweet (or whatever) about your contributions if you like!

Following these guidelines will ensure a better experience for you and for us.

Guidelines for submissions
--------------------------

Infrastructore of a repository in GIT provides an amount of instruments for open source communication and so, project pledges to use them at their max capacity.

### Submitting an issue

Before you submit an issue, please, search the issue tracker: an issue for your problem might already exist and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily avalaible.

Developers want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug, we need to reproduce and confirm it: in order to reproduce bugs, we require that you provide a minimal reproducible scenario gives us a wealth of important information without going back and forth to you with additional questions.

Minimal reproduction allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding problem) as well as confirm that we're fixing the right problem.

Developer require minimal reproduction to save maintainers time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs: often, developers find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal reproduction - we understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essential bits of code from a larger codebase, but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.

Unfortunately, we are not able to investigate or fix bugs without minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you, we are goung to close an issue that doesn't have enough info to be reproduced.

### Submitting pull request (PR)

Before submitting your PR consider to follow these guidelines:

1. search on repository for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission: you don't want to duplicate existing efforts;
2. be sure that an issue describes the problem you are fixing, or documents the design for the feature you'd like to add, discussing the design upfront helps to ensure that we're ready to accept your work;
3. \* if it was asked, sign the CLA before sending PRs: we cannot accept code without a signed CLA, make sure you author all contributed git commits with email address associated with your CLA signature.
4. fork the repository;
5. in your forked repository, make your changes in a new git branch;
6. create your patch, including appropriate check and testing;
7. follow coding conventions or write the simillar to existing if it breaches existing conventions;
8. commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows [CMC (or commit message convention)](./docs/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md), adherence, to these conventions is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages;
9. push your branch to the repository;
10. on GITHUB, send a PR to the main production branch;

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top" title="Back to the top of MD file">[^]</a></p>


    ```powershell
    git checkout -b [BRANCH_NAME]
    git commit --all
    git push origin [BRANCH_NAME]
    ```
### Reviewing pull request

Developer reserves the right not to accept pull requests from community members who haven't been good citizens of the community: such behaviour includes not following COC (or code of conduct) and applies within or outside project's managed channels.

**Addressing review feedback.**

If we ask for changes via code reviews then:

1. make the required updates to the code;
2. re-run the CLI tests and build with no-traverse your version to ensure tests are still passing;
3. create fixup commit and push to your forked repository (this will update your PR):

    ```powershell
    git commit --all --fixup HEAD
    git push
    ```

    For more info on working with fixup commits look for an - [MD article in Angular documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/docs/FIXUP_COMMITS.md).

**Updating the commit message.**

A reviewer might often suggest changes to a commit message (for example, to add more context for a change or adhere to commit message guidelines) - in order to update the commit message of the last commit on your branch:

1. checkout your branch;
2. amend the last commit and modify the commit message;
3. push to your forked repository:

    ```powershell
    git checkout [BRANCH_NAME]
    git commit --amend
    git push --force-with-lease
    ```

> If you need to update the commit message of an earlier commit, you can use rebase in interactive mode, look for the GIT docs for more details about this procedure - [interactive mode with GIT rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_interactive_mode).

**After your pull request is merged.**

If your PR was merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main upstream repository (same within forked repository):

1. delete the remote branch either through web client UI or through local shell;
2. checkout the main branch;
3. delete your local branch;
4. update your local branch of upstream with the latest version of origin's upstream:

    ```powershell
    git push origin [BRANCH_NAME]
    git checkout master -f
    git branch -D [BRANCH_NAME]
    git pull -ff upstream master
    ```

Comitting conventions
-----------------

For consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working with project's open source:

- all features or bug fixes must be tested;
- all public API methods must be documented;

For advanced commiting convention, see specified documentation file - [COMMIT CONVENTION](docs/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md).

Signing the CLA
---------------

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top" title="Back to the top of MD file">[^]</a></p>

Sometimes you can be asked to sign the CLA (or contributor license agreement) before sending the PR: for any code changes to be accepted, the CLA must be signed - its a quick and easy process.

- for individuals:\
    https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual
- for corporations, print, sign and scan with email, fam or mail the given form:\
  https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate

If you have more than one accounts, or multiple email addresses associated with a single account, you must sign the CLA using the primary email address of the GITHUB account used to author git commits and sending PRs.
