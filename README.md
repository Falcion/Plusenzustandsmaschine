## README

THIS IS ALMOST AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED README.

This project, or as I called it as "Plusenzustandmsch" is a C++ port of my another project called [Zustandsmaschine](https://github.com/Falcion/Zustandsmaschine) which represents advanced representation of sequencers from DBs and state machine from animators in game engines conceptions on classic clear-code programming languages, allowing advanced process of inside-debugging perception by "sharding" any task, method to states with custom shifts via assemblers, deployments and analyzers.

**Quote from Zustandsmaschine's synopsis:**

> Sinopsis of program:
> Zustandmaschine has a very-big hard-connected hierarchy between objects itself.
> But there are three global "assemblies" in entire package:
> 1. Stateflow itself: maid from enums of states and shifts, defines most simple object which works alike JSON with given structure ?> and some given methods.
> 2. Assembler of stateflow: the machine, which contains stateflow inside and works with it through specified context, updating specified-injected data, etc.
> 3. Analyzer and deployment machine: the most hard-working module of package which works with every branch of stateflow's assembler and gets its data into one local deployment with history, hash-ID and etc., which is thrown with custom data-type when assembler is closed down.
> All three modules can be used independently from simplest to hardest, but main goal of it is user-preferenced usage of deployment in assembler, which can give log of method's "path of code" and etc. via correct and specified way of using.
